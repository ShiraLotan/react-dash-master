App Design:

1. App component is the main container for the entire app.

2. The Chart component can be quite flexible, properties can be easily added.

3. Layout is flex based.

4. External libraries: lodash, react-redux, react-router-dom, recharts, redux, redux-logger, redux-thunk.

5. In Features component 'setFetchData' function located out side of the render. I decided to use Redux-Thunk middleware and for this purpose only
   i'v located the function outside of the render. This method doesn't depend on variables which it receives from its enclosing closure. Since I'm using 'setFetchData' outside useEffect I disabled the rule using // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps otherwise I would move the method inside of useEffect

6. Bonus task: for this I used 'Redux-Logger'. After clicking you should see a console data of the state. This feature will be availble
   in dev mode only.

7. app contains 3 reducers and combind them





This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
